    <h2>Who is the queen of hearts? </h2>
      <p> The Queen of Hearts is a fictional character from the book Alice's Adventures in Wonderland by the writer Lewis Carroll. She is a foul-tempered monarch whom Carroll himself describes as "a blind fury", and who is quick to give death sentences at the slightest offense. One of her most famous lines is the oft-repeated <strong>"Off with his/her head!" / "Off with their heads!"</strong></p>

<p>The Queen is referred to as a card from a pack of playing cards by Alice, yet somehow she is able to talk and is the ruler of the lands in the story, alongside her husband, the King of Hearts. She is often confused with the Red Queen from the sequel, Through the Looking-Glass, although the two are very different.</p>
