  <p>In <a href="https://kingdomhearts.fandom.com/wiki/Kingdom_Hearts_(game)">Kingdom hearts</a> The Queen of Hearts was an intra-world "villain" that appeared in a major role in Wonderland. Despite insisting on Alice being decapitated for trying to steal the Queen's heart, the Queen was apparently in no way associated with Maleficent. Also, as she was not entirely evil, the Queen isn't completely a villain, even though she and her Soldiers are bosses. She accused Alice for attempted theft of her heart in a trial. When Alice was ordered to been executed, Sora, Donald and Goofy intervened to convince The Queen that Alice was innocent. The Queen didn't believe them, but agreed to free Alice if they could find evidence for her innocence. With the help of the Cheshire Cat, they found evidence but the Queen refused to believe it and ordered the Keyblade master's execution. After a fight with The Queen's soldiers, Alice was kidnapped by the Heartless. The Queen made a ceasefire with Sora, Donald and Goofy so she would be able to find Alice.</p>

The Queen appeared in Castle Oblivion as a figment of Sora's memory. In the memory recreation of Wonderland, the Queen accused Alice of stealing her memory and sentenced her to death. Even after Sora and co. found the real culprit, she still refused to believe that Alice was innocent. Fortunately, Alice's quick thinking pacified the Queen and no one had to lose their head. </p>
